# **SecureDev AI**
### AI-Powered Application Security Platform

*Shift-Left Security from Requirements to Deployment*

---

## SLIDE 2: The Problem

### **Why Application Security is Broken**

| Problem | Industry Reality |
|---------|------------------|
| **Security comes too late** | 70% of vulnerabilities found post-deployment (Veracode) |
| **Threat modeling skipped** | Only 25% of orgs do it regularly (Ponemon) |
| **Developers lack guidance** | 86% say they lack security training (GitLab) |
| **Fixes take too long** | 84 days average to remediate (ServiceNow) |
| **Tools create friction** | 67% say tools disrupt workflow (JetBrains) |
| **Secrets leak constantly** | 6M+ secrets exposed on GitHub in 2023 |

### **Result: $4.5M average breach cost** (IBM 2024)

---

## SLIDE 3: The Cost of Late Security

### **Fixing Vulnerabilities: The 100x Problem**

| Stage | Cost to Fix | Time to Fix |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **Requirements** | $80 | Hours |
| **Design** | $240 | Days |
| **Development** | $960 | Days |
| **Testing** | $2,400 | Weeks |
